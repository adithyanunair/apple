        <p>Our environmental goals.</p>
        <p class="a7">As part of our efforts to reach carbon neutrality by 2030, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max do not include
            a power adapter or EarPods. Included in the box is a USB‑C to Lightning Cable that supports charging and is
            compatible with USB‑C power adapters and computer ports.

            We encourage you to re‑use your current USB‑A to Lightning cables, power adapters and headphones that are
            compatible with these iPhone models. But if you need any new Apple power adapters or headphones, they are
            available for purchase.
